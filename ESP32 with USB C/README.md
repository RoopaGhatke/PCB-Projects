This project features a 4 layer custom ESP32-S3 development board designed in Altium Designer, following the tutorial “How to Make a Custom ESP32 Board in Altium Designer” by Robert Feranec. 
The board is built around the ESP32-S3-MINI-1-N8 module, offering dual-core performance with integrated with USB-to-UART interface suitable for low-power embedded IoT applications.

Features
1. ESP32-S3-MINI-1-N8 Module
2. USB-to-UART Interface (for firmware upload and serial debugging)
3. 3.3V Voltage Regulator (Reverse polarity protection and Overcurrent safeguard)
4. Reset and Boot Buttons
5. Breakout GPIO Header Pins for: I2C, UART, PWM
6. Design Best Practices Implemented
Proper decoupling capacitors close to power pins
Ground plane continuity with minimal return path interference
Controlled impedance trace routing for USB paths
3D Model Preview for mechanical verification
Includes:
Schematic files (.SchDoc)
PCB layout (.PcbDoc)
Bill of Materials (BoM)
Pick & Place files

The PCB board is developed from scratch for learning purposes, this design helped me gain hands-on experience in schematic creation, PCB layout, component placement and design for manufacturability.
