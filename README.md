This repository showcases a collection of PCB design projects created using Altium Designer and KiCad. 
Each project involves complete development from schematic design to PCB layout and 3D model visualization.
These designs were developed from scratch as part of my self-learning journey, following well-structured tutorials to understand and apply industry-standard design principles. 
These projects not only helped me gain hands-on experience with PCB design tools and workflows, but also deepened my understanding of hardware design concepts, electrical best practices and design-for-manufacturing (DFM) techniques.
