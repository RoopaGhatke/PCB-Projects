This project demonstrates the schematic design, single-layer PCB layout, and component placement of a 5V Linear Voltage Regulator Board, created using Altium Designer.  
This project follows best practices in component placement, decoupling, and signal flow on a single-layer board.

Overview
This project was developed from scratch as part of a self-learning initiative, following online resources and tutorials to gain hands-on experience in power electronics and PCB design using Altium. 
The design includes:
Input and output connectors
Proper filtering and decoupling capacitors
Reverse polarity protection diode
Standard component footprints and through-hole layout
The goal was to understand regulator circuit behavior and practice PCB layout on a single-layer board.

Features
1. L7805ACV Linear Voltage Regulator (Output: 5V; Max Current: up to 1.5A)
2. Reverse Polarity Protection (Schottky diode (1N5711) on input)
3. Capacitor Network (Proper placement for regulator stability)
4. Single-Layer PCB Design (Simplified routing)
5. Optimized for manual soldering and low-cost fabrication
6. Connectors (J1: Power Input (2-pin header); J2: Regulated Output (2-pin header))

Files Included
Complete schematic file (VoltageRegulator1.SchDoc)
PCB layout file (VoltageRegulator1.PcbDoc)
Bill of Materials with footprint and part descriptions

The board is built around the L7805ACV linear regulator and provides a stable 5V DC output from a higher voltage input. Designed from scratch following tutorials for learning and educational purposes.
